    <p class='intro-para' >We probably all know what sweet potatoes are. 
      They’re basically different colored potatoes, that are sweet. But do 
      you know what yams are? Many people confuse sweet potatoes and yams. 
      Yams probably don’t look like you think they do. Yams are brown and 
      hairy. They are also in the shape of an oval. Yams are basically 
      stretched-out coconuts. In this website I will prove to you why yams 
      are the best vegetable to eat.</p>

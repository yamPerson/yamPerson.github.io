    <p class='intro-para' >We probably all know what sweet potatoes are. 
      They’re basically different colored potatoes, that are sweet. But do 
      you know what yams are? Many people confuse sweet potatoes and yams. 
      Yams probably don’t look like you think they do. Yams are brown and 
      hairy. They are also in the shape of an oval. Yams are basically 
      stretched-out coconuts. In this website I will prove to you why yams 
      are the best vegetable to eat.</p>
    <p class='intro-para' > Yams are high in Vitamin C, Vitamin B-6, and Magnesium. Yams also contain smaller amounts of Iron, Vitamin A, Calcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B-12.

Vitamin C is probably more helpful than you think. It contains Collagen, which helps with healing wounds; proteins that make your body tissues stronger, and helpful chemical that can lower the risk of certain types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and scurvy.

Vitamin B-6 houses 6 helpful minerals (Which is why it’s called Vitamin B-6). They are pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, Pyridoxal 5’ Phosphate, pyridoxamine 5’ phosphate, and Vitamin B. They control metabolism, carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acid in the blood.

Yams contain 7% Magnesium. This is the cutoff for the minerals I will explain. Everything below 7% I will not talk about (this includes Iron, Vitamin A, Calcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B-12). Magnesium contains more than 300 helpful enzymes! Some of these help with bone, DNA, and RNA development. Others help with heart rhythm and energy production.
Eating yams could increase your lifespan by 9 years. This is because yams can lower your risk of cancer. The average person usually lives to the age of 79. Cancer usually kills people when they are 70 years old. In the next 10 years, the risk of cancer will go up by 20%! 79 minus 70 is nine. Nine years is about 13% of the average person’s lifespan. The catch is, there’s only a 30% chance it will work.</p>
